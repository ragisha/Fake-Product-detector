# 🛡️ Fake-Product Detector

## 🚀 Overview
Fake-Product Detector is a **college project** with a vision to combat counterfeit products using **QR code verification**. The project integrates **Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP**, and **Android Studio** to develop a comprehensive **application** that ensures product authenticity.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** PHP, Python  
- **Mobile Development:** Android Studio  

## 🎯 Project Vision
This project embodies a **startup concept** focused on generating **bulk QR codes** tailored to client specifications. These QR codes serve as an **authentication layer**, allowing users to verify product legitimacy by scanning the code via the **dedicated application**.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. **QR Code Generation:** Generate and customize QR codes based on client requirements.
2. **Product Authentication:** Users scan the QR code via the mobile app to access product details.
3. **Fake Product Detection:** Counterfeit products lack valid QR verification, ensuring consumer trust.
4. **Demo App Integration:** A prototype application is available to demonstrate QR scanning and validation.

## 🎬 Demo & Proof of Concept
To showcase the functionality, we developed a **demo app** allowing users to scan QR codes and retrieve embedded product information.

## 🌟 Why This Matters
✅ Prevents counterfeit products  
✅ Enhances consumer trust  
✅ Provides an innovative **anti-fraud** solution  

This project is **not just an academic exercise**—it’s a glimpse into real-world applications of **QR-based authentication**. 🚀
